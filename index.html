      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>I am excited to begin this journey into a brand new career path. In the past, I've been a "Jill of all trades" providing everything from business analysis, executive support, meeting and event planning, IT recruiting, and procurement. No career path has harnessed my desire to creatively and logically solve problems like web development. I can't wait to join a team and provide clean, innovative solutions for client problems. </p>

      <p>In my free time, I love being able to serve and encourage others. I volunteer career services to returning veterans, helping them find a civillian fit for their service experience. As an avid reader, I met my 2017 goal of finishing a book every two weeks. In 2018, I'm doubling my goal and attempting 52 books in 52 weeks. I also love to attempt to cook - the fire department isn't on speed dial yet! </p>
